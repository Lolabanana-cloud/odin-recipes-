    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This open-faced smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel is a great breakfast or brunch offering. Most grocery stores sell presliced smoked salmon and cream cheese, which makes this recipe a snap to put together and even easier to serve.</p>
    <p>Salmon that has been smoked means it has undergone a process of curing and has been hot- or cold-smoked. Due to its moderately high price, smoked salmon is considered a delicacy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium bagels, split and toasted</li>
        <li>6 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons capers, drained and divided</li>
        <li>6 ounces thinly sliced smoked salmon or lox</li>
        <li>1/3 cup thinly sliced red onion</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread the toasted bagel bottom halves with cream cheese. Sprinkle half the capers over the cream cheese, if desired.</li>
        <li>Top with sliced smoked salmon.</li>
        <li>Garnish the bagel tops with the rest of the capers, onion, and black pepper. Garnish with fresh lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
