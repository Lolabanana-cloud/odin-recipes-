    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Our family definitely loves a traditional lasagna recipe, but sometimes it is time to change it up! That’s where this delicious recipe comes in. It is basically all the same flavors of lasagna, but deconstructed as a cozy bowl of soup. The flavors are amazing and you have to top it with our easy ricotta mixture and freshly grated parmesan cheese! Option to make it dairy-free or gluten-free and the whole family is going to love it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole Ricotta Cheese</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>

        <li>Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To start making this easy soup, we like to begin by whipping up the ricotta mixture in a medium mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>In a large pot over medium-high heat, cook ground beef and sausage until browned. Season with salt and pepper as you cook. Drain grease and remove meat from the pot.</li>
        <li>In a large pot heat olive oil over medium heat. Toss in diced onion and sauté for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add in minced garlic and cook for another minute or two.</li>
